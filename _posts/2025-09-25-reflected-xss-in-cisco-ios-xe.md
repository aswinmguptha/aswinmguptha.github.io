title: "From Hospital Pentest to Cisco Advisory: A Reflected XSS in Cisco IOS XE"
section: blog
---

### TL;DR
During a hospital security assessment, we discovered a <span class="highlight">reflected XSS vulnerability</span> in Cisco IOS XE Web UI. The issue identified as <span class="highlight">CVE-2025-20240</span> could allow attackers to <span class="highlight">steal session tokens</span> via crafted links.

We reported it to Cisco PSIRT, and after multiple meetings and environment recreations, Cisco confirmed the bug and published an official <span class="highlight">security advisory</span>.

Affected devices should be <span class="highlight">patched immediately</span>. Details are available in the [Cisco advisory](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webui-xss-VWyDgjOU).

## üìñ The Story

Security assessments often take us into environments where technology and human lives are closely connected. During one such <span class="highlight">hospital security assessment</span>, we stumbled upon a vulnerability with far-reaching implications.

While testing the web management interface of Cisco IOS XE devices, we discovered a <span class="highlight">reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability</span>. This meant that an attacker could trick someone into clicking a malicious link, and if successful, the attacker could <span class="highlight">steal session cookies</span> and hijack accounts of <span class="highlight">any website</span> the victim has logged into. In a hospital setting, this could even mean access to network devices <span class="highlight">critical for patient care</span>.

The vulnerability was captured in our <span class="highlight">proof-of-concept artifacts</span>, including screenshots and request/response logs, but once the assessment concluded, <span class="highlight">our access to the hospital environment ended</span>. When Cisco PSIRT later requested additional details and live reproduction steps, we no longer had the original setup to demonstrate the issue.

This could have stalled the investigation ‚Äî but Cisco‚Äôs collaboration was invaluable. They held multiple meetings with us, patiently walking through every detail we could recall about the environment and its configuration. After several iterations, Cisco successfully <span class="highlight">recreated the exact environment</span> and were able to fully <span class="highlight">confirm and validate the vulnerability</span>.

## üîç The Problem: What Went Wrong

The web interface of Cisco IOS XE devices <span class="highlight">failed to sanitize user-supplied input</span>. So when a user clicked a specially crafted link, <span class="highlight">malicious script could be reflected back</span>. If a victim‚Äôs browser then executes that reflected payload, it opens room for cookie/token theft or session hijacking.

From a technical standpoint, this is a **reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE‚Äôs Web UI. The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2025-20240**, and has a CVSS score of 6.1. Under certain configurations, attackers could trick victims into visiting a crafted URL and <span class="highlight">exfiltrate tokens or cookies of any website</span>, the victim has logged into, to a domain under their control, making this a <span class="highlight">pseudo universal xss</span>.

If exploited, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to run arbitrary scripts in the context of the Web UI, potentially stealing cookies, tokens, or session identifiers.

## üóìÔ∏è The Disclosure Journey

Here‚Äôs how the journey unfolded:

| Date                   | Milestone                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **June 28, 2024**      | Initial vulnerability report submitted to Cisco PSIRT with reproduction steps, impact, and potential fixes.                                    |
| **July 11, 2024**      | Cisco acknowledged and opened an incident ticket.                                                                                  |
| **July 2024**          | Back-and-forth clarifications, screenshot requests, and later a request for video PoC.                                                         |
| **July‚ÄìAugust 2024**   | Multiple discussions and Webex calls to reconstruct the environment. Since we no longer had access, Cisco engineers recreated it step by step. |
| **August 28, 2024**    | Cisco successfully reproduced the issue in their environment.                                                                                          |
| **September 24, 2025** | Cisco published the official advisory and defect notice.                                                                                       |

Cisco PSIRT‚Äôs professionalism and persistence were commendable‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt drop the case when evidence was limited but instead worked closely with us to validate the issue properly.
