title: "From Exploitation to Education: Building Secure Coding Challenges for Real-World Impact"

### TL;DR  
As a security engineer, I regularly work with real-world vulnerabilities in web, mobile, and API systems. Alongside that, I also design <span class="highlight">secure coding challenges</span> that replicate these vulnerabilities in simplified, hands-on environments. These challenges are crafted to <span class="highlight">teach developers how security issues occur</span> and how to <span class="highlight">write safer code through practical experience</span>. It’s about going beyond bug fixing to <span class="highlight">encourage a mindset shift</span>—from “does this work?” to <span class="highlight">“is this secure?”</span>.

## 🧭 The Journey

Over the years working in security engineering, I’ve come across the same types of issues repeatedly—access control misconfigurations, insecure input handling, broken logic in APIs. I’ve exploited them in live systems, written detailed reports, and recommended fixes.

But over time, I realized I wanted to do more than just find vulnerabilities. I wanted to help people understand them. Not through documentation or slides, but <span class="highlight">through experience</span>. That’s why I started building secure coding challenges—an environment where developers can learn security concepts by *doing*, not just reading.

This post walks through how I approach challenge design, why realism matters, and how these challenges help change the way developers think about writing secure code.

## 🛡️ Why Secure Coding Matters


As a security engineer, I've spent countless hours reviewing insecure code, exploiting flaws in web and mobile apps, and uncovering logic issues in APIs. But somewhere along the way, a thought kept returning: <span class="highlight">What if developers could discover these bugs before I did?</span>

It's easy to assume that security issues only happen when developers are careless. In reality, they often happen when people are trying to move fast, meet deadlines, or implement features without deep knowledge of how an attacker might think.

I’ve reviewed enough vulnerable code and exploited enough systems to see the patterns. But I’ve also worked with developers who, <span class="highlight">once they understood the risks, were quick to change</span> how they approached problems. That shift in mindset—from reactive fixing to proactive thinking—is what these challenges aim to support.

Reading about the OWASP Top 10 is useful, but actually <span class="highlight">exploiting a broken access control</span> flaw in a sandboxed challenge <span class="highlight">teaches the lesson in a way that sticks.</span>

## 🧩 Simulating Real-World Vulnerabilities

When I build a challenge, I start by thinking about issues I’ve seen during actual engagements. The idea is to replicate those flaws in a simplified environment that’s safe to break and learn from.

Some examples:

- An API challenge that lets a user access another account by tweaking the `user_id` parameter.  
- A deserialization challenge that leads to remote code execution when crafted input is passed to a vulnerable function.  
- A seemingly harmless form that becomes a lesson in server-side template injection.

These aren’t puzzles for the sake of puzzles. They’re grounded in <span class="highlight">real attack patterns</span>, crafted to show how a <span class="highlight">small oversight can lead to serious consequences.</span>

## 🎯 Guiding Developers Instead of Just Testing Them

The goal of these challenges isn’t to stump people. They’re built to teach. Every aspect of the experience—from the vulnerable code or API behavior to the final explanation—is designed to guide the participant toward understanding <span class="highlight">what went wrong and how to prevent it</span>.

A typical challenge includes:

- A short, realistic backstory that sets the context  
- A codebase or endpoint that behaves just like a production service might  
- Subtle clues and hints that nudge toward the vulnerability  
- A solution walkthrough that breaks down the root cause and secure fix  

By working through the problem directly, developers aren’t just learning how to exploit an issue—<span class="highlight">they’re learning how not to create one.</span>

## 🧠 Beyond Solves: Shifting the Developer Mindset

What I enjoy most about building these challenges is seeing how they help shift people’s thinking. I’ve seen developers go from treating security as something separate to seeing it as a natural part of design and development.

They start asking different questions:  
Not just “Does this work", But <span class="highlight">“What happens if someone misuses this?”</span>  
Not just “How fast can I build this?”, But <span class="highlight">“How can I build this safely?”</span>

That shift is what makes the effort worth it.

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Security isn’t just about finding bugs or writing secure code. It’s also about helping others <span class="highlight">build the awareness and confidence</span> to do the same. While I continue to work on offensive and defensive security as part of my day job, building secure coding challenges is one way I contribute to improving the developer experience.

🎯 Whether you're a developer trying to improve your security skills, or someone who wants to understand how attackers think, <span class="highlight">challenge-based learning</span> is one of the most effective tools we have.
