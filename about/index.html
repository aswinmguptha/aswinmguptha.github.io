          I'm Aswin M Guptha — <span class="highlight">I break things, fix them, and help others learn how to do both.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I work in application security with a focus on web, API, and mobile apps. My role sits at the intersection 
          of <span class="highlight">security and engineering</span> — making sure the things we build are not only functional but resilient. 
          Whether it’s reviewing code, shaping threat models, or embedding checks into CI/CD pipelines, I believe security should enhance, not interrupt, 
          how teams work.

        <p class="bio-text">
          Over the years, I've led security initiatives at <strong>Traboda CyberLabs</strong>, guided developers through remediation, and helped shape 
          how security fits into the broader engineering lifecycle. I also speak at conferences, train dev teams, and occasionally dig into open-source 
          projects to report vulnerabilities — <span class="highlight">a few of which have earned CVEs</span>.

          I've been part of <strong>Team bi0s</strong> for years — <span class="highlight">mentoring researchers</span>, contributing to CTF wins, and 
          helping organize some of <span class="highlight">India’s most recognized cybersecurity competitions</span> like InCTF and InCTF Junior. I’ve seen 
          firsthand how community can change careers, and I try to give back every chance I get.

          My work isn’t about just finding bugs — it’s about <span class="highlight">solving the right problems, enabling teams to move securely, and building 
              things that actually scale</span>. I believe the best security work disappears into the product — not because it’s invisible, but because it’s 
              designed right.

          Outside of work, I stay curious — reading writeups, writing tools, experimenting with edge cases, or building challenges for others to learn from.
